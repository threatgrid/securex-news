As with previous roundups, this post isn't meant to be an in-depth analysis. Instead, this post will summarize the threatsx we've observed by highlighting key behavioral characteristics, indicators of compromise, and discussing how our customers are automatically protected from these threats. </p><p>As a reminder, the information provided for the following threats in this post is non-exhaustive and current as of the date of publication. Additionally, please keep in mind that IOC searching is only one part of threat hunting. Spotting a single IOC does not necessarily indicate maliciousness. Detection and coverage for the following threats is subject to updates, pending additional threat or vulnerability analysis. For the most current information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center, <a href=\"https://www.snort.org\">Snort.org</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.clamav.net\">ClamAV.net</a>. </p><a name='more'></a><p>For each threat described below, this blog post only lists 25 of the associated file hashes and up to 25 IOCs for each category. A visual depiction of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques associated with each threat is also shown. In these images, the brightness of the technique indicates how prevalent it is across all threat files where dynamic analysis was conducted.  There are five distinct shades that are used, with the darkest indicating that no files exhibited technique behavior and the brightest indicating that technique behavior was observed from 75 percent or more of the files. </p><p>The most prevalent threats highlighted in this roundup are: </p> <table class=\"threats-table\"><thead><tr>    <th width=\"160px\">Threat Name</th>    <th width=\"80px\">Type</th>    <th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody> <tr><td class=\"threat-name-col\">  Win.Ransomware.Cerber-9826975-1 </td><td>    Ransomware </td><td>    Cerber is ransomware that encrypts documents, photos, databases and other important files. Historically, this malware would replace files with encrypted versions and add the file extension \".cerber,\" although in more recent campaigns other file extensions are used. </td></tr> <tr><td class=\"threat-name-col\">  Win.Packed.Banload-9827015-0 </td><td>    Packed </td><td>    Banload is a banking trojan believed to be developed by Brazilian cybercriminals and is used primarily to infect machines in Latin America. One notable aspect of Banload is it's use of custom kernel drivers to evade detection. </td></tr> <tr><td class=\"threat-name-col\">  Win.Trojan.Winwebsec-9828352-0 </td><td>    Trojan </td><td>    Winwebsec installs itself on a compromised system as \"anti-malware\" software with desktop links and various persistence techniques (Windows service, Registry Run key, etc.). This family is known for using fake alerts for malware found on the system to deceive users into buying services before the \"malware\" can be removed. </td></tr> <tr><td class=\"threat-name-col\">  Win.Trojan.Fareit-9829230-0 </td><td>    Trojan </td><td>    The Fareit trojan is primarily an information stealer that can download and install other malware. </td></tr> <tr><td class=\"threat-name-col\">  Win.Packed.Tofsee-9827033-0 </td><td>    Packed </td><td>    Tofsee is multi-purpose malware that features several modules used to carry out various activities such as sending spam messages, conducting click fraud, mining cryptocurrency and more. Infected systems become part of the Tofsee spam botnet and are used to send large volumes of spam messages in an effort to infect additional systems and increase the overall size of the botnet under the operator's control. </td></tr> <tr><td class=\"threat-name-col\">  Win.Spyware.Zbot-9827050-0 </td><td>    Spyware </td><td>    Zbot, also known as Zeus, is a trojan that steals information like banking credentials.

As with previous roundups, this post isn't meant to be an in-depth analysis. Instead, this post will summarize the threatsx we've observed by highlighting key behavioral characteristics, indicators of compromise, and discussing how our customers are automatically protected from these threats. \nAs a reminder, the information provided for the following threats in this post is non-exhaustive and current as of the date of publication. Additionally, please keep in mind that IOC searching is only one part of threat hunting. Spotting a single IOC does not necessarily indicate maliciousness. Detection and coverage for the following threats is subject to updates, pending additional threat or vulnerability analysis. For the most current information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center, Snort.org, or ClamAV.net. \n\nFor each threat described below, this blog post only lists 25 of the associated file hashes and up to 25 IOCs for each category. A visual depiction of the MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with each threat is also shown. In these images, the brightness of the technique indicates how prevalent it is across all threat files where dynamic analysis was conducted.  There are five distinct shades that are used, with the darkest indicating that no files exhibited technique behavior and the brightest indicating that technique behavior was observed from 75 percent or more of the files. \nThe most prevalent threats highlighted in this roundup are: \n \n    Threat Name    Type    Description\n \n  Win.Ransomware.Cerber-9826975-1     Ransomware     Cerber is ransomware that encrypts documents, photos, databases and other important files. Historically, this malware would replace files with encrypted versions and add the file extension \".cerber,\" although in more recent campaigns other file extensions are used. \n   Win.Packed.Banload-9827015-0     Packed     Banload is a banking trojan believed to be developed by Brazilian cybercriminals and is used primarily to infect machines in Latin America. One notable aspect of Banload is it's use of custom kernel drivers to evade detection. \n   Win.Trojan.Winwebsec-9828352-0     Trojan     Winwebsec installs itself on a compromised system as \"anti-malware\" software with desktop links and various persistence techniques (Windows service, Registry Run key, etc.). This family is known for using fake alerts for malware found on the system to deceive users into buying services before the \"malware\" can be removed. \n   Win.Trojan.Fareit-9829230-0     Trojan     The Fareit trojan is primarily an information stealer that can download and install other malware. \n   Win.Packed.Tofsee-9827033-0     Packed     Tofsee is multi-purpose malware that features several modules used to carry out various activities such as sending spam messages, conducting click fraud, mining cryptocurrency and more. Infected systems become part of the Tofsee spam botnet and are used to send large volumes of spam messages in an effort to infect additional systems and increase the overall size of the botnet under the operator's control. \n   Win.Spyware.Zbot-9827050-0     Spyware     Zbot, also known as Zeus, is a trojan that steals information like banking credentials. It contains many malicious features, including keylogging and form-grabbing. \n   Win.Packed.Razy-9828691-0     Packed     Razy is oftentimes a generic detection name for a Windows trojan. It collects sensitive information from the infected host, encrypts the data and sends it to a command and control (C2) server. Information collected may include screenshots. The samples modify auto-execute functionality by setting and creating a value in the registry for persistence. \n   Win.Ransomware.Ruskill-9827186-1     Ransomware     Ruskill, also known as Dorkbot, is a botnet client aimed at stealing credentials and facilitating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It spreads via removable media and through instant messaging applications. \n   Win.Malware.Python-9827194-0     Malware     Win.Malware.Python is a generic name given to malware written in Python and, typically, compiled into a Windows executable using tools like PyInstaller. There is a vast array of supporting libraries, proof-of-concept exploit tools, and example code that makes developing malware in Python easier than with lower-level languages. Examples of functionality commonly seen in this type of malware include the ability to spread laterally by exploiting EternalBlue PoC scripts and file encryption performed by ransomware. \n \n

protects users from a variety of malware functions with exploit     prevention. Exploit prevention helps users defend endpoints from memory attacks commonly     used by obfuscated malware and exploits. These exploits use certain features to bypass     typical anti-virus software, but were blocked by AMP thanks to its advanced scanning     capabilities, even protecting against zero-day vulnerabilities.     \n     \n                 \n                    Crystalbit-Apple DLL double hijack detected - (8905)             \n    \n                    Crystalbit-Apple DLL double hijack was detected. During this attack, the adversary abuses two legitimate vendor applications, such as CrystalBit and Apple, as part of a dll double hijack attack chain that starts with a fraudulent software bundle and eventually leads to a persistent miner and in some cases spyware deployment.             \n             \n                    Process hollowing detected - (8791)             \n    \n                    Process hollowing is a technique used by some programs to avoid static analysis. In typical usage, a process is started and its obfuscated or encrypted contents are unpacked into memory. The parent then manually sets up the first stages of launching a child process, but before launching it, the memory is cleared and filled in with the memory from the parent instead.             \n             \n                    Excessively long PowerShell command detected - (2004)             \n    \n                    A PowerShell command with a very long command line argument that may indicate an obfuscated script has been detected. PowerShell is an extensible Windows scripting language present on all versions of Windows. Malware authors use PowerShell in an attempt to evade security software or other monitoring that is not tuned to detect PowerShell based threats.             \n             \n                    A Microsoft Office process has started a windows utility. - (1664)             \n    \n                    A process associated with Microsoft Office, such as EXCEL.exe or WINWORD.exe, has started a Windows utility such as powershell.exe or cmd.exe. This is typical behavior of malicious documents executing additional scripts. This behavior is extremely suspicious and is associated with many malware different malware campaigns and families.             \n             \n                    Dealply adware detected - (602)             \n    \n                    DealPly is adware, which claims to improve your online shopping experience. It is often bundled into other legitimate installers and is difficult to uninstall. It creates pop-up advertisements and injects advertisements on webpages. Adware has also been known to download and install malware.             \n             \n                    Kovter injection detected - (511)             \n    \n                    A process was injected into, most likely by an existing Kovter infection. Kovter is a click fraud Trojan that can also act as an information stealer. Kovter is also file-less malware meaning the malicious DLL is stored inside Windows registry and injected directly into memory using PowerShell. It can detect and report the usage of monitoring software such as wireshark and sandboxes to its C2. It spreads through malicious advertising and spam campaigns.             \n             \n                    Squiblydoo application whitelist bypass attempt detected. - (479)             \n    \n                    An attempt to bypass application whitelisting via the \"Squiblydoo\" technique has been detected. This typically involves using regsvr32.exe to execute script content hosted on an attacker controlled server.             \n             \n                    CVE-2019-0708 detected - (128)             \n    \n                    An attempt to exploit CVE-2019-0708 has been detected. The vulnerability, dubbed BlueKeep, is a heap memory corruption which can be triggered by sending a specially crafted Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) request. Since this vulnerability can be triggered without authentication and allows remote code execution, it can be used by worms to spread automatically without human interaction.             \n             \n                    Gamarue malware detected - (81)             \n    \n                    Gamarue is a family of malware that can download files and steal information from an infected system. Worm variants of the Gamarue family may spread by infecting USB drives or portable hard disks that have been plugged into a compromised system.             \n             \n                    Installcore adware detected - (32)             \n    \n                    Install core is an installer which bundles legitimate applications with offers for additional third-party applications that may be unwanted. The unwanted applications are often adware that display advertising in the form of popups or by injecting into browsers and adding or altering advertisements on webpages. Adware is known to sometimes download and install malware.","id":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1029833275466591797.post-2348722556176833781","isoDate":"2021-02-05T20:50:00.001Z"}],"link":"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/search/label/SecureX","feedUrl":"https://www.blogger.com/feeds/1029833275466591797/posts/default/-/SecureX","title":"Cisco Talos Intelligence Group - Comprehensive Threat Intelligence","lastBuildDate":"2021-02-12T10:00:04.783-05:00"}
