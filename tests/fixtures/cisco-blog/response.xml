					<description><![CDATA[The cyber attack on Oldsmar's water plant shows how critical infrastructures have become vulnerable to cyber threats. How can water utilities keep modernizing operations while ensuring public safety and regulatory compliance?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On February 8, 2021, the City of Oldsmar, Florida gave a press conference to disclose “an unlawful intrusion to the city’s water treatment system.” Someone on the Internet successfully accessed the computer controlling the chemicals used to treat drinking water for the city and changed the level of sodium hydroxide to 11,100 parts per million (ppm), a significant increase from the normal amount of 100 ppm.</p>
<p>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), also known as lye or caustic soda, is a corrosive chemical used in low concentrations to regulate pH level of drinking water and protect water pipes. In higher levels, it is toxic and can damage human tissues. Luckily, the attack was immediately detected, and normal operating parameters were restored before any harm could be done.</p>
<p>While security controls such as automated pH testing would have prevented the poisoned water from being distributed, this story highlights how much critical infrastructures, such as water utilities, have become vulnerable to cyber attacks. The City of Oldsmar should be credited for its transparency and candid explanation of what happened.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>What happened?</strong></span></h2>
<p>According to the city sheriff, someone on the Internet managed to connect to the TeamViewer software that was installed on the workstation used to control the water treatment process. TeamViewer is a popular tool used by technicians and support personnel to gain remote access to a computer and use it as if they were physically in front of it.</p>
<p>An employee of the water treatment plant saw the mouse cursor moving on the workstation screen performing unauthorized tasks. He raised the alarm and thwarted the attack before anyone was harmed. The sheriff had no information on how the hacker gained access to the plant’s IT network or how it was able to log into the TeamViewer application.</p>
<p>Most IT professionals would be very surprised. How did this industrial workstation become accessible from the Internet? How could remote access capabilities be installed without proper security policies and strong authentication being enforced? How could someone set process parameters to dangerous levels without specific authorizations and controls?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this type of situation is not uncommon. Operations staff and equipment vendors need remote access into industrial machines and sometimes install unapproved solutions by themselves. Most industrial equipment has no cybersecurity feature. Default passwords are widely used for technicians to gain easier access to machines. Many industrial organizations have not built a demilitarized zone (DMZ) to isolate industrial networks, leaving these vulnerable devices accessible from IT networks. And the list could go on.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Making cybersecurity top of mind</strong></span></h2>
<p>As for all industry verticals, digitization brings tremendous benefits to the water industry. But it also increases the threat landscape. The solution is not about refraining from modernizing operations. It’s about building strong security protocols into industry digitization projects from day 1. It’s also about gaining factual information on the organization’s security posture so that IT and operations teams can start working together securing industrial networks.</p>
<p>In the United States, the America’s Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA) requires water utilities serving more than 3,300 people to develop or update risk assessments and Emergency Response Plans (ERPs). In the European Union, the NIS Directive classifies water utilities as critical infrastructures that must identify their cybersecurity risks, train their personnel, and build measures for response and recovery. This, and other recommendations, are well described in the whitepaper Cisco recently published on <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/industries/white-paper-c11-743927.html?dtid=oblgcdc000651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cybersecurity for water utilities</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>What can water utilities do next?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Public safety, digital operations, and regulations demand water utilities to deploy reliable and robust cybersecurity. In the short term, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/firewalls/index.html?dtid=oblgcdc000651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">installing a firewall</a> to isolate the industrial network and blocking unauthorized traffic (such as TeamViewer) is the mandatory first step.</p>
<p>In parallel, two main efforts must be made to implement security best practices and enable modern connected industrial operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gaining clear visibility on all the industrial devices, systems and software that have been deployed over the years. Long story short: you cannot protect what you don’t know.</li>
<li>Enabling effective collaboration between IT and OT teams to design and enforce security policies that will help operations staff do their work effectively without disrupting production.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gaining visibility into your industrial infrastructure can be done manually. You can also use OT security software such as <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/cyber-vision/index.html?dtid=oblgcdc000651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco Cyber Vision</a> to automatically build a detailed asset inventory listing all devices, software, vulnerabilities, remote accesses, network relationships, process behaviors, etc. Such a tool provides precise information to build a plan for improvement. It can also monitor operations to ensure that any malicious activity is immediately detected by something other than luck.</p>
<p>Now that IT and OT have a shared understanding of the situation, they can work together in building a security framework that suits operational constraints. Both teams have everything to win. As explained in <a href="https://engage2demand.cisco.com/LP=24564?dtid=oblgcdc000651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this white paper</a>, when it comes to OT security, united we stand, divided we fall.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cisco Secure Workload’s native integration with Firepower Management Center allows micro-segmentation policies to be pushed to Cisco firewalls, extending workload micro perimeters with macro network perimeter enforcement.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post was authored by <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/tag/Frank-Dickson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frank Dickson</a>, Program Vice President, Cybersecurity Products, IDC</em></p>
<p>The best kept secret in cloud workload security is that Cisco is number two in revenue market share according to IDC, just shy of $100 million in 2019 and almost certain to exceed $100 million in 2020 (please stay tuned). The reason for the &#8220;secret&#8221; is that the path that Cisco has taken is a bit atypical for Cisco. In other security markets, entry has been made through acquisition, including Duo Security, CloudLock, Sourcefire, Lancope, OpenDNS and Threat Grid to name a few. In cloud workload security, Cisco started in a different place; its organically grown, focusing on the needs of enterprises rather than the cloud native start-ups. Instead of targeting workloads natively developed in greenfield IaaS opportunities, Cisco originally targeted existing applications whether they be in on-premises, private clouds (essentially virtualized datacenters) or in public clouds, the enterprise solution addressed enterprise pain points.</p>
<p>The goal was to help datacenter administrators with security measures for enterprise applications. Application dependencies can be extremely opaque. Thus, protection of &#8220;those&#8221; applications can be quite challenging. You know &#8220;those&#8221; applications—the applications critical to the business but written 20 years ago in COBOL by developers who left years ago. And, by the way, &#8220;those&#8221; applications are typically quite brittle. And there can be a lot of them in a mature datacenter.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>The Role of Cisco Secure Workload</strong></span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/tetration/index.html?dtid=osscdc000283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco Secure Workload (formally known as Tetration)</a> addressed problem of protecting existing applications in virtualized datacenters as well as in public cloud by changing the enforcement scope from hard perimeter-based strategies (the macro) to the micro (the workload). The solution works by automating application dependency for visibility and policy generation. Thus, allow-list policies could be generated, and enforced right on the workload itself.</p>
<p>Essentially, think of Cisco Secure Workload as creating visibility in a sea of applications and then allow for the careful enforcement of L3 and L4 micro perimeter segmentation policies. A data administrator might not need to understand the functions of all the components of an application. However, now the administrator will know that an application can only communicate only on required ports and protocols to required workloads there by eliminating hackers attempt to laterally move and breach applications.</p>
<p>As enterprise customers migrate some or all of their workloads from on-premises private clouds to IaaS, Cisco Secure Workload essentially extended the micro perimeter segmentation approach to hybrid multicloud workloads.</p>
<p>Today, L3 and L4 micro perimeter policies based on application behavior alone is just not enough for enterprises. Enterprises have security operations centers (SOCs) that address of the needs of the oceans of on-premises and cloud compute resources. These SOCs aggressively leverage automation to tackle the Herculean task of cloud workload security; automation demands integration. To address 2021 enterprise needs, Cisco Secure Workload has a plethora of integrations to extend these micro perimeter policies definitions.</p>
<p>An important security need was addressed by Cisco Secure Workload’s native integration with the Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), the cornerstone of Cisco perimeter automation. Within datacenters, datacenter firewalls create the macro perimeter and at the security zone boundaries. Native integration with FMC allows Cisco Secure Workload to push policies to Cisco firewalls, extending micro perimeters with macro perimeter enforcement. A key benefit of this is to effectively segment application workloads where Cisco Secure Workload cannot natively enforce policies on the workload itself. This macro perimeter integration is not Cisco-limited, as integrations are also available for load balancers such as F5 and Citrix and third-party firewall products through orchestration platforms such as AlgoSec and Tufin.</p>
<p>Finally, ingesting security intelligence through STIX/TAXII, the widely accepted standards for threat intelligence, has been become a critical requirement. Organizations may subscribe to numerous threat intelligence feeds. Many of indicators of compromise (IOC) will not be relevant; some IOCs will be critical. Finding the relevant IOCs accurately and at scale via automation is a 2021 enterprise requirement, as SOCs cannot spare valuable analysts perform such repetitive yet important tasks. Cisco Secure Workload will now ingest security intelligence through STIX/TAXII and automate the process.</p>
<p>The larger point is that Cisco took a different approach to workload security, focusing on the needs of the enterprise. The company’s micro perimeter and integration strategies highlight the point. Frankly, greenfield IaaS use cases are easier; Cisco is looking to help address the use cases that are not so easy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Threat hunting serves the dual purpose of managing top risks, as well as avoiding major incidents. Adam Tomeo talks with Eric Hulse to understand how it helps achieve security outcomes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A report for everyone at every level of security, the Security Outcomes Study was released in December.  In the report, we surveyed more than 4,800 IT, security and privacy professionals to find out what matters most in their security practice.  Topics such as tech refresh, risk management, and incident response were examined from the perspective of a roadmap for success in an information security program for organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p>The findings of the Security Outcomes Study <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/new-year-new-outcomes-how-we-can-do-better-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">are interesting</a>, with correlations that generate strong inferences between topics. To understand more deeply how the findings of the report are applicable to those who work with the day-to-day operations, from intelligence gathering, to all the other security operations, we decided to interview a security practitioner.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;">An expert’s eye on the findings</span></h2>
<p>We spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehulse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Hulse</a>, Director of Security Research at Cisco to gain his insights into what were some of the most interesting findings of the study, and how it can be used to achieve success in a security program.</p>
<p>Eric found the study to be useful, as it shows there is a business impact in performing certain best factors.  “The report does a great job of amalgamating and highlighting why these topics are important. Having this data at our hands allows us to align our risk exposure to do some of the important work.” Eric stated quite clearly that &#8220;there is nothing more vexing to an IT professional than conveying to superiors why something needs to be. This report helps us align those reasons and obtain buy-in from management as they understand the criticality of why something needs to be done&#8221;.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;">Cost minimization – a CEO’s best friend</span></h2>
<p>Another example of how the report reflects findings that align with management as well as with the security operations is through the findings about the value of threat hunting.  In the past, most executives viewed cybersecurity as a rear-view mirror problem; cybersecurity was a reactive practice.  This is not necessarily the best business strategy. After all, the threat landscape is much different now than it was just a few years ago, and businesses are more at risk to threats today than ever before &#8212; and therefore a better, more proactive measure like threat hunting is now imperative.</p>
<p>Threat hunting serves the dual purpose of managing top risks, as well as avoiding major incidents.   Both risk, and cost are top of mind for the C-suite. The greater the threats, the longer they stay undetected and unresolved, the greater the cost to the brand when a breach happens.  This also results in a greater cost for repair and cleanup, both technically, and reputationally.  Proactively hunting for threats minimizes the risk and cost of a breach.  Not only that, but it goes towards cost-minimization, as well as minimizing unplanned work.  These are the types of things that raise the confidence of the team all the way up to the C-Level.</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-1-408x200.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-354560" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-1-408x200.png" alt="Effect of various practices on desired outcomes" width="600" height="618" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;">A practitioner’s roadmap to success</span></h2>
<p>From a practitioner’s perspective, threat hunting enables us to better work through our incident response capabilities. Eric Hulse makes a note that one figure in the Security Outcomes Study indicates that 40% of respondents were less likely to agree that they learned anything from prior instances.  However, this only fortifies the importance of threat hunting.  “Every incident needs to be propagated over to threat hunting to build and continue to establish more hypotheses and vectors for future hunting.”</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-2.png"><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-2-300x54.png 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-2.png 556w' sizes='(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-354561" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-2.png"   alt="Percent of respondents who strongly agree their firm allows each security practice" width="700" height="127" /></a></p>
<p>One may wonder why an organization would go directly to threat hunting as a security approach, rather than the traditional route of pen testing?  Thanks to the recent efforts of many dedicated professionals, Cisco has become a &#8220;change agent&#8221; that helps democratize and simplify threat hunting for organizations.  When we consider all the various professional “breach investigation” reports and “institute” findings of the last few years, many of them remark about the “dwell time” of a cyber incident, that is, how long the attackers remained undetected in a system prior to the discovery of the breach event.  With technology advancements and improved feature sets, including products like Cisco’s Secure Endpoint Premier with SecureX Threat Hunting puts threat hunting well within the reach of all companies, no matter the size or security maturation level they have already achieved.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;">Don’t throw out the old</span></h2>
<p>To be clear, all the legacy methods are still valid as part of a layered defense. The respondents in the Security Outcomes Study make the point that a tech refresh is among the most important factors of a successful security program.  There is a strong connection between threat hunting and tech refresh.  For example, one of the problems of old technology is that it is often forgotten, or never updated, leaving it in a vulnerable state.  Threat hunting can help to uncover these weaknesses, which will further emphasize the need for updated technology.</p>
<p><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-3-300x138.png 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-3.png 623w' sizes='(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-354562" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Democratizing-Threat-Hunting-Fig.-3.png"   alt="Practices most strongly correlated with overall security program success" width="700" height="321" /></p>
<p>It is understandable that many organizations are not at the point of security maturity to incorporate threat hunting into their defense posture.  That makes a stronger justification for keeping a proactive tech refresh at the top of every budget discussion.  In time, tech refresh and threat hunting should be part of the standard security approach in all organizations.  Eric puts it very bluntly, “At its essence, security is about managing risk. However, when you are assigning architectural controls to mitigate that risk, it lacks validation.  Threat hunting is part the next evolution of risk management.”</p>
<p>It becomes evident that the Security Outcomes Study has something for every level of the corporate security chain.  As <a href="https://twitter.com/wendynather" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendy Nather</a>, Head of Advisory CISOs, Duo Security at Cisco so eloquently puts it at the beginning of the report, “This is not a marketing report to toss in your swag bag and ignore; this is a report to cuddle up with and read over and over again. In fact, this report will change how we think about running infosec programs.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Are there really “quick wins” for your security program? Wendy Nather, Head of Advisory CISOs at Duo Security, goes deeper into the Security Outcomes Study and reveals the findings. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re always looking for the &#8220;quick wins&#8221; in security — whether it&#8217;s the magic blinky box that you drop into the right place in your network and it stops all the bad stuff (let me know if you find one of those), or the secret incantation that you can perform that doesn&#8217;t cost money but adds protection to your armor. The &#8220;one weird trick&#8221; sometimes leads to clicks; I once got the head of one of the biggest tech companies on the planet to click on my analyst report using that title. But clicks aren&#8217;t solutions, and only the customer can decide whether something is really a solution.</p>
<p>In the Security Outcomes Study, we asked respondents which security practices they felt they were managing to do, but at the other end of the scale, we didn&#8217;t want to ask them whether they were bad at them. Nobody wants to say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t care about this practice,&#8221; or &#8220;We&#8217;re really bad at this.&#8221; So, we framed it as &#8220;agreeing&#8221; and &#8220;disagreeing&#8221; with the practice statements, such as “My organization meets established SLAs or deadlines for remediating disclosed vulnerabilities in systems and software.” We thought it might be easier for someone to say, &#8220;I disagree,” because it could be attributed to a lot of factors: they don&#8217;t prioritize it, there&#8217;s some constraint that they can&#8217;t get around, their management doesn&#8217;t care about it, they don&#8217;t have the budget, they haven’t implemented it across the board, and so on. So when they said they were &#8220;disagreeing,&#8221; we don&#8217;t actually know whether a given practice was hard to do, or blocked for another reason, but we can guess from our own experiences that it might not be straightforward to accomplish.</p>
<p>Given those caveats as a backdrop, let&#8217;s look at some comparisons between security practices that many respondents said they were doing or not doing, and security practices that appeared to have a strong statistical correlation with good security outcomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture1_Quick-Wins-Blog.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture1_Quick-Wins-Blog-300x214.png 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture1_Quick-Wins-Blog.png 596w' sizes='(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px' loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-354544 size-full" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture1_Quick-Wins-Blog.png"   alt="Safe Investments versus Quick Wins from Cisco Security Outcomes Study" width="596" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>The figure shown here places all security practices on grid according to the percentage of respondents reporting adherence (x axis) and the increase in probability of overall program success attributed to each practice.</p>
<p>Practices toward the upper right are, according to the data, more often implemented successfully and are highly correlated with gains in program success. The somewhat bad/sad news is that there aren’t any practices that land squarely in that quadrant. Sorry folks — as we know, security is hard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//players.brightcove.net/1384193102001/41XYD7gTx_default/index.html?videoId=6209709854001" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen width="640" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Quick Wins</strong></span></h2>
<p>Short of that, we can examine the lower right and middle-ish areas of the chart to see which practices are still significantly correlated but appear to be achievable by more respondents. &#8220;Clear reporting to execs&#8221; is probably the quickest win, followed by a toss-up between &#8220;Sound security strategy&#8221; and &#8220;IT &amp; security work together.&#8221; That’s pretty interesting because they’re non-technical controls that weren’t that common in our main report. They&#8217;re also difficult to substantiate or quantify: what you think is clear reporting to your executives might not seem clear to them. What does a &#8220;sound security strategy&#8221; look like as opposed to an &#8220;unsound&#8221; one? And everyone can say that IT and security &#8220;work together,&#8221; but which areas of cooperation are the most important? We have an opportunity here to dig deeper in future research.</p>
<p>More achievable, plus significantly correlated with overall success? This is probably the closest to a “quick win” that we’re going to get. Don’t ignore the other practices here just because the data scientists didn’t label them as “statistically significant.” If you group a number of them together, you might turn them into significant boosts (see below).</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Safe Investments</strong></span></h2>
<p>It’s also worth noting that the practices in the upper left (hard but effective) are the ones that kept showing up in the report. We’ve labeled those “safe investments” because the data strongly supports their weighty contribution to security program success &#8230; but those gains likely won’t come easy for every organization. They not only require strong cooperation across the board, with all areas of IT and external partners, but they may be hard to justify from a functional standpoint: the tech works fine, why should we keep updating it?</p>
<p>The one thing this chart doesn&#8217;t capture is the potential cumulative effect of doing several of the practices. Each one here is mapped against its individual likelihood of contributing to your program&#8217;s success, but if you did, say, five of the ones that most respondents say they were able to do well, how would that increase your outcomes? I&#8217;m not a data scientist myself, but I would caution against the temptation to take these numbers and add or multiply them somehow (2% + 2% +3% equals a 7% better outcome!). Remember, these statistics aren&#8217;t guarantees, but it&#8217;s probably safe to say that even if one practice, successfully done, didn&#8217;t pan out to improve your outcomes, doing a few more practices well would raise your chances of getting some level of improvement.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is that &#8220;quick wins&#8221; in security are neither quick, nor are they a total win. But we did make you click, didn&#8217;t we? And you may find some practice areas to focus on that are more easily achievable and have a good chance of incrementally boosting your organization&#8217;s security posture.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[How can we simplify remote access, provide resiliency for telemetry sources, reduce organizational risk AND provide the visibility into policy required to embrace zero trust and network segmentation? Read the Cisco Secure Network Analytics Release 7.3.1 blog to find out.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have heard it before. Securing your organization isn&#8217;t getting any easier. The remote workforce is expanding the attack surface. We need context from users and endpoints to control proper access, and IT teams need to ensure our data stores are resilient and always available to gain the telemetry they need to reduce risk. Yes, zero trust is a great approach, but network segmentation in the workplace is hard, and it can shut down critical business functions if not deployed correctly.</p>
<p>To answer these challenges, we are excited to announce new features in <a href="https://www.cisco.com/go/secure-network-analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco Secure Network Analytics (formerly Stealthwatch).</a> In 7.3.1, we are introducing TrustSec-based visualizations that allow network operations and security teams to instantly validate the intent of policies. This is a big jump that provides organizations the visibility required to confidently embrace network segmentation, a critical component of the zero-trust workplace.</p>
<p>To answer the remote work challenge, the Cisco Secure Network Analytics team has simplified how customers obtain user and endpoint context from AnyConnect. And to ensure the expanded attack surface doesn’t increase risk, Secure Network Analytics has advanced its integration with Cisco Talos, one of the largest threat intelligence teams in the world. But there is more; read on to learn how we virtualized the Data Store to simplify how organizations big and small ensure resiliency and manage the growing volumes of data required to stay a step ahead in the arms race that is network security.</p>
<h2><strong>TrustSec Analytics reports offer new ways to visualize group communications between SGTs</strong></h2>
<p>Secure Network Analytics&#8217; <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/stealthwatch/sna-trustsec-matrix-analytics-report-aag.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrustSec Analytics reporting capability</a> leverages the Report Builder application and its integration with Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to automatically generate reports that map communications between Security Group Tags (SGTs) to provide users with unprecedented visibility into all communications across different groups within their environment. For security teams that want to adopt a group-based policy management program to build network segmentation but lack the resources to pursue one, TrustSec Analytics reporting lowers the entry point to doing so. Now any Secure Network Analytics user can effortlessly visualize, analyze, drill down into any inter-group communication, adopt the right policies, and adapt them to their environment&#8217;s needs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_354125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-354125" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/TrustSecAnalytics-300x197.png 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/TrustSecAnalytics-768x504.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/TrustSecAnalytics-1024x673.png 1024w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/TrustSecAnalytics.png 1116w' sizes='(max-width: 1116px) 100vw, 1116px' loading="lazy" class="wp-image-354125" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/TrustSecAnalytics.png"   alt="TrustSec Analytics Report" width="800" height="525" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-354125" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> A TrustSec Analytics report generated in Secure Network Analytics that displays volumetric communications between different SGTs that have been assigned and pulled directly from ISE.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Streamline policy violation investigations with TrustSec Policy Analytics reports</strong></h2>
<p>TrustSec Policy Analytics reports can also be generated to assess whether policies are being violated. By clicking on any cell in the report, users can gain insights into the volume of data being sent between any two groups, how that data is being distributed, the protocols being used, what ports they are operating on, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, when it comes to the typically lengthy processes associated with determining a policy violation’s root cause, the capabilities offered by the TrustSec Policy Analytics report quite literally enable users to find the proverbial ‘offending-flow needles’ in their vast ‘network haystacks’. Rather than performing hours of cumbersome tasks such as conducting manual searches and cross-references across different datasets, users can get granular by drilling down into policy violations to view all associated IPs and related flows, associated endpoints, ISE-registered usernames, and events with timestamps on single pane. This effectively enables users to streamline their root cause analysis efforts and expedite their ability to diagnose why a policy violation occurred.</p>
<figure id="attachment_354126" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-354126" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/PolicyAnalytics-300x179.png 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/PolicyAnalytics-768x458.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/PolicyAnalytics.png 810w' sizes='(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px' loading="lazy" class="wp-image-354126" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/PolicyAnalytics.png"   alt="TrustSec Policy Analysis" width="800" height="477" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-354126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> A TrustSec Policy Analytics report generated in Secure Network Analytics with intuitive color-coded cells and labels that indicate whether communications between different SGTs are violating a policy and require further investigation.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Increased Remote Worker Telemetry</strong></h2>
<p>Amidst the recent explosion of people working from home, organizations face new challenges related to monitoring and securing their remote workforces as they connect back to the network from anywhere and on anything.</p>
<p>Secure Network Analytics has made endpoint Network Visibility Module (NVM) data the primary telemetry source to meet these challenges, effectively eliminating the need for NetFlow to gain user and device context. Customers are gaining the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified remote worker monitoring with endpoint NVM data becoming a primary telemetry source</li>
<li>More efficient remote worker telemetry monitoring by collecting and storing on-network NVM endpoint records without the need for NetFlow</li>
<li>Increased Endpoint Concentrator ingestion bandwidth to support up to 60K FPS</li>
<li>NVM driven custom alerting and endpoint flow context</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Introducing the Secure Network Analytics Virtual Data Store!</strong></h2>
<p>The Secure Network Analytics Data Store is now supported as a virtual appliance offering. Similar to the <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/introducing-the-cisco-secure-network-analytics-data-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Store that was introduced in 7.3.0</a>, the virtual Data Store offers a new and improved database architecture design for Secure Network Analytics that enables new ways of storing and interacting with data more efficiently. A virtual Data Store supports a 3-node database cluster with flow ingest from virtual Flow Collectors.  This new architecture decouples ingest from data storage to offer the following benefits:</p>
<ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Maintaining the resiliency of data, assets, systems, and the network is mission-critical. DevOps must continuously improve resiliency with application security tools that automate security posture assessment and manage security risks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is part one of a four-part blog series about <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/tag/cisco-devsecops-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevSecOps</a>.</em></p>
<p>Technology is at the core of business today. Maintaining the resiliency of critical data, assets, systems, and the network is mission-critical; crucial to meeting business goals. As a result, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/cloud/what-is-devops.html?dtid=osscdc000283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">development operations (DevOps)</a> professionals must continuously improve the overall resilience —along with the security posture — of workloads, software, and applications (Figure 1). To do this at scale and speed requires the integration of a suite of application security tools in the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that automate posture assessment and provide visibility to help manage security risks.</p>
<p>At Cisco, we learned early on that application security processes were inhibiting our business agility. We knew we had to embrace an Agile and DevOps culture as early adopters to deliver software products based on business demands rapidly and iteratively. Agile DevOps without application security automation leads to a &#8220;hurry up and wait&#8221; situation, where some processes move quickly only to be bogged down by others. With evolving technologies such as cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, open-source as well as daily and frequent release cycles, it is hard for application security teams to keep up with the threat landscape. In a typical modern application development and deployment technology stack, 80% of the code base is comprised of third-party software. Only 20% is custom code. Most of the security breaches we have seen in recent years were entirely preventable had there been necessary security measures taken, not only for the custom code but also for the third-party software.</p>
<p>We set out to create a DevSecOps culture that empowers the application teams to continuously build and deploy secure applications instead of being gated by a central security function. To do this, we integrated and orchestrated a suite of application security tools within CI/CD pipelines under a program called Continuous Security Buddy (CSB) for CI/CD pipeline edition. It enables the development teams to ramp up their application security program while making application security transparent and friction-free.</p>
<figure id="attachment_353628" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-353628" style="width: 626px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture3-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture3-1-300x166.png 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture3-1.png 626w' sizes='(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px' loading="lazy" class="wp-image-353628 size-full" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture3-1.png"   alt="DevSecOps: Security Implemetation as Code" width="626" height="347" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-353628" class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Figure 1: DevSecOps – Security Implementation as Code</strong></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We used the following basic principles in the design of the program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-design and co-develop the security automation solution so it can work for the DevOps teams</li>
<li>Integrate the DevSecOps workflow and empower the developers by giving them the flexibility to choose their application security tools</li>
<li>Propagate security compliance requirements and hence eliminate the security friction points between security and development teams that impact development velocity</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Co-design and Co-development of the Solution</strong></span></h2>
<p>We initially co-designed and co-developed CSB for CI/CD re-usable automated security capabilities using joint scrum planning with teams from <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/conferencing/webex.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco Webex</a>. To encourage adoption across development teams, we created an innovative, configurable rollout of CSB for CI/CD shared libraries to simplify the process.</p>
<p>Shared libraries are a collection of pipeline code made for Jenkins that can be used by any pipeline to reference any available code quickly. With one line of code in Jenkins, developers can access all the security scans available in the shared library. The shared library framework simplifies the code contribution workflow via the inner-source process and reusable code configuration in the pipeline by any team using Jenkins.</p>
<p>We quickly learned that we needed to provide CI-agnostic solutions for teams that used other CI tools. We offered such a solution using containers that are published in a centralized repository for development teams to access via Docker.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Security Scan Flexibility</strong></span></h2>
<p>Users can choose what type of automated security scans they want to configure and run. For example, a production pipeline may consist of a binary image scan, static code analysis scans, and a way to view a consolidated report of scans. The final step in the automation process is to send the scan results aligned to Security Control Framework (SCF) to a centralized security platform to meet compliance requirements. These features are all available as part of the shared library and the user needs to add configuration parameters to run it. As part of the CI process, security scans are configured and triggered to run whenever there is a code change. Developers can then continuously monitor the scan results for any new security issues.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Automated Compliance Reporting </strong></span></h2>
<p>Using the CSB for CI/CD shared library, teams can view reports generated from each security scan on the Jenkins dashboard and identify any failing security issues. Teams can also send the security results data to a centralized interface to Jira to help in various assessment processes, such as reviews by security architects. A consolidated report is generated (as shown in Figure 2), which shows an overall compliance score that considers which scans were enabled in the job, (e.g., binary scans, static code analysis, and dynamic scans). Developers can then use this report to view any quick fixes to improve the security posture.</p>

CSB for CI/CD Scan Report</strong></span></figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Measuring Progress</strong><strong> and Success</strong></span></h2>
<p>After initial development with our Webex team, we scaled the CSB CI/CD approach across several business units at Cisco. We measured the agility, reliability, efficiency, quality, and success of the CSB for CI/CD shared library to ensure the system was operating effectively.</p>
<p>With the program now in place for over a year, some of business value we were able to deliver is captured in Figure 3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #6abf4b;"><strong>Summary and Key Take-Aways</strong></span></h2>
<p>CSB for CI/CD is an automation framework that utilizes both open source and inner source security tools to provide developers with an easy way to run and view security scans. By adopting the CSB for CI/CD framework, organizations can proactively build and release secure software.</p>
<p>The framework, along with models such as inner sourcing, allows for the collaboration, speed, and scale needed in large enterprises where many development teams are using a multitude of technologies. It empowers distributed application teams to secure their applications while providing visibility to centralized governance teams.</p>
<p>We’ll deep dive into some of the critical security features that we enabled, including Software Composition Analysis (SCA), Container Security, Static Application Security Testing (SAST), and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) in the next blog series. We’ll also include strategies being employed to monitor for architecture drift and continuous threat modeling once an application has gone live to further complement our framework for continuous security.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Applications are the lifeblood of digital business. Cisco is bringing the best of AppDynamics and Security to secure applications, to help application and security teams protect their environments, and applications at runtime.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no surprise that the events of 2020 drastically changed the IT landscape, as millions of people began working from home, accessing apps from a multitude of devices on public internet and service providers. As organizations embraced hybrid/multi-cloud technologies, vastly expanding the perimeter of IT, they also faced an unprecedented rise in malicious security threats and a growth in modern applications complexity—all testing the limits of monitoring practices.</p>
<p>The quantity¹ and frequency² of hacker attacks, coupled with the typical time³ to identify and contain a breach, then multiplied by the various applications running on-prem, multi-cloud and cloud-native microservices, security risk remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>And that formula just doesn’t work for our customers’ security posture.</p>
<p>Protecting customers’ applications are the lifeblood of digital business. The Cisco Security Platform &amp; Response (SP&amp;R) partnered with AppDynamics to build a new approach to application security – one that protects business-critical applications continuously from inside-out.</p>
<p>Introducing Cisco Secure Application.</p>
<p>Cisco Secure Application protects applications at runtime, detects and block attacks in real-time, and simplifies the lifecycle of security incidents by providing application and business context and creating a shared context across Application and Security teams. Natively built into AppDynamics full-stack observability platform, Cisco Secure Application embeds security into the application runtime without adding performance overhead to unlocks security insights without friction.</p>
<p>Needed now more than ever, Cisco Secure Application continuously detects vulnerabilities and threats, block attacks, and provides business context so teams can prioritize remediation by business impact.  It helps security teams investigate breaches, an essential factor in business continuity, turning thousands of hours of prevention and detection into seconds, enabling customers to reduce friction and catch threats in moments, not months.</p>
<p>Cisco Secure Application is the first line of defense, an organic layer of security and an integral part of a comprehensive monitoring strategy from within the application runtime—and for every application environment.  With awareness into the application topology and business context, AppOps can scope a security incident and understand the potential impact to users and the business and strategically prioritize response. SecOps can achieve visibility into attacks based on deep application insight that eases alert fatigue and provides shared context when talking to application teams. Security professionals can identify runtime vulnerabilities and fixes with business value prioritization.</p>
<p>Shared context and insights enable users to ensure peak performance and security posture.</p>
<p>Cisco Secure Application is the only solution purpose-built to protect business-critical applications, no matter where they run, from the inside out, to maintain speed and uptime. As part of AppDynamics, Cisco Secure Application brings together business, performance, and security insights to protect organizations from slowdowns and exploits. It detects vulnerabilities and automatically blocks attacks to protect applications, end users, and business.</p>
<p>Our portfolio strength is the value we deliver to customers.</p>
<p>Cisco SecureX’s built-in platform experience helps CISOs and IT decision-makers with SecOps, ITOps and NetOps maximize operational efficiency to secure networks, users and endpoints, cloud edge, and applications, delivering faster remediation with better precision and eliminating the friction and repetition in processes.</p>
<p>When there’s a customer need, SP&amp;R innovates to solve the problem, affording them a competitive edge. That’s the fierceness of competition, and what drives our ability to innovate for our customers.  And as we build the best products in cyber security—and in leading the App Security space—we continue to power our customers business and the industry forward, securely. Period.</p>
