      "content:encoded": "<p>A report for everyone at every level of security, the Security Outcomes Study was released in December.  In the report, we surveyed more than 4,800 IT, security and privacy professionals to find out what matters most in their security practice.  Topics such as tech refresh, risk management, and incident response were examined from the perspective of a roadmap for success in an information security program for organizations of all sizes.</p>\n<p>The findings of the Security Outcomes Study <a href=\"https://blogs.cisco.com/security/new-year-new-outcomes-how-we-can-do-better-in-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">are interesting</a>, with correlations that generate strong inferences between topics. To understand more deeply how the findings of the report are applicable to those who work with the day-to-day operations, from intelligence gathering, to all the other security operations, we decided to interview a security practitioner.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #6abf4b;\">An expert’s eye on the findings</span></h2>\n<p>We spoke with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehulse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Eric Hulse</a>, Director of Security Research at Cisco to gain his insights into what were some of the most interesting findings of the study, and how it can be used to achieve success in a security program.</p>\n<p>Eric found the study to be useful, as it shows there is a business impact in performing certain best factors.  “The report does a great job of amalgamating and highlighting why these topics are important. Having this data at our hands allows us to align our risk exposure to do some of the important work.” Eric stated quite clearly that &#8220;there is nothing more vexing to an IT professional than conveying to superiors why something needs to be. This report helps us align those reasons and obtain buy-in from management as they understand the criticality of why something needs to be done&#8221;.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #6abf4b;\">Cost minimization – a CEO’s best friend</span></h2>\n<p>Another example of how the report reflects findings that align with management as well as with the security operations is through the findings about the value of threat hunting.  In the past, most executives viewed cybersecurity as a rear-view mirror problem; cybersecurity was a reactive practice.  This is not necessarily the best business strategy. After all, the threat landscape is much different now than it was just a few years ago, and businesses are more at risk to threats today than ever before &#8212; and therefore a better, more proactive measure like threat hunting is now imperative.</p>\n<p>Threat hunting serves the dual purpose of managing top risks, as well as avoiding major incidents.   Both risk, and cost are top of mind for the C-suite.

      "content:encodedSnippet": "A report for everyone at every level of security, the Security Outcomes Study was released in December.  In the report, we surveyed more than 4,800 IT, security and privacy professionals to find out what matters most in their security practice.  Topics such as tech refresh, risk management, and incident response were examined from the perspective of a roadmap for success in an information security program for organizations of all sizes.\nThe findings of the Security Outcomes Study are interesting, with correlations that generate strong inferences between topics. To understand more deeply how the findings of the report are applicable to those who work with the day-to-day operations, from intelligence gathering, to all the other security operations, we decided to interview a security practitioner.\nAn expert’s eye on the findings\nWe spoke with Eric Hulse, Director of Security Research at Cisco to gain his insights into what were some of the most interesting findings of the study, and how it can be used to achieve success in a security program.\nEric found the study to be useful, as it shows there is a business impact in performing certain best factors.  “The report does a great job of amalgamating and highlighting why these topics are important. Having this data at our hands allows us to align our risk exposure to do some of the important work.” Eric stated quite clearly that “there is nothing more vexing to an IT professional than conveying to superiors why something needs to be. This report helps us align those reasons and obtain buy-in from management as they understand the criticality of why something needs to be done”.\nCost minimization – a CEO’s best friend\nAnother example of how the report reflects findings that align with management as well as with the security operations is through the findings about the value of threat hunting.  In the past, most executives viewed cybersecurity as a rear-view mirror problem; cybersecurity was a reactive practice.  This is not necessarily the best business strategy. After all, the threat landscape is much different now than it was just a few years ago, and businesses are more at risk to threats today than ever before — and therefore a better, more proactive measure like threat hunting is now imperative.\nThreat hunting serves the dual purpose of managing top risks, as well as avoiding major incidents.   Both risk, and cost are top of mind for the C-suite. The greater the threats, the longer they stay undetected and unresolved, the greater the cost to the brand when a breach happens.  This also results in a greater cost for repair and cleanup, both technically, and reputationally.  Proactively hunting for threats minimizes the risk and cost of a breach.  Not only that, but it goes towards cost-minimization, as well as minimizing unplanned work.  These are the types of things that raise the confidence of the team all the way up to the C-Level.\n\nA practitioner’s roadmap to success\nFrom a practitioner’s perspective, threat hunting enables us to better work through our incident response capabilities. Eric Hulse makes a note that one figure in the Security Outcomes Study indicates that 40% of respondents were less likely to agree that they learned anything from prior instances.  However, this only fortifies the importance of threat hunting.  “Every incident needs to be propagated over to threat hunting to build and continue to establish more hypotheses and vectors for future hunting.”\n\nOne may wonder why an organization would go directly to threat hunting as a security approach, rather than the traditional route of pen testing?  Thanks to the recent efforts of many dedicated professionals, Cisco has become a “change agent” that helps democratize and simplify threat hunting for organizations.  When we consider all the various professional “breach investigation” reports and “institute” findings of the last few years, many of them remark about the “dwell time” of a cyber incident, that is, how long the attackers remained undetected in a system prior to the discovery of the breach event.  With technology advancements and improved feature sets, including products like Cisco’s Secure Endpoint Premier with SecureX Threat Hunting puts threat hunting well within the reach of all companies, no matter the size or security maturation level they have already achieved.\nDon’t throw out the old\nTo be clear, all the legacy methods are still valid as part of a layered defense.

Nobody wants to say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t care about this practice,&#8221; or &#8220;We&#8217;re really bad at this.&#8221; So, we framed it as &#8220;agreeing&#8221; and &#8220;disagreeing&#8221; with the practice statements, such as “My organization meets established SLAs or deadlines for remediating disclosed vulnerabilities in systems and software.” We thought it might be easier for someone to say, &#8220;I disagree,” because it could be attributed to a lot of factors: they don&#8217;t prioritize it, there&#8217;s some constraint that they can&#8217;t get around, their management doesn&#8217;t care about it, they don&#8217;t have the budget, they haven’t implemented it across the board, and so on. So when they said they were &#8220;disagreeing,&#8221; we don&#8217;t actually know whether a given practice was hard to do, or blocked for another reason, but we can guess from our own experiences that it might not be straightforward to accomplish.</p>\n<p>Given those caveats as a backdrop, let&#8217;s look at some comparisons between security practices that many respondents said they were doing or not doing, and security practices that appeared to have a strong statistical correlation with good security outcomes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture1_Quick-Wins-Blog.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture1_Quick-Wins-Blog-300x214.png 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture1_Quick-Wins-Blog.png 596w' sizes='(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px' loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-354544 size-full\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture1_Quick-Wins-Blog.png\"   alt=\"Safe Investments versus Quick Wins from Cisco Security Outcomes Study\" width=\"596\" height=\"426\" /></a></p>\n<p>The figure shown here places all security practices on grid according to the percentage of respondents reporting adherence (x axis) and the increase in probability of overall program success attributed to each practice.</p>\n<p>Practices toward the upper right are, according to the data, more often implemented successfully and are highly correlated with gains in program success. The somewhat bad/sad news is that there aren’t any practices that land squarely in that quadrant. Sorry folks — as we know, security is hard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"//players.brightcove.net/1384193102001/41XYD7gTx_default/index.html?videoId=6209709854001\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #6abf4b;\"><strong>Quick Wins</strong></span></h2>\n<p>Short of that, we can examine the lower right and middle-ish areas of the chart to see which practices are still significantly correlated but appear to be achievable by more respondents. &#8220;Clear reporting to execs&#8221; is probably the quickest win, followed by a toss-up between &#8220;Sound security strategy&#8221; and &#8220;IT &amp; security work together.&#8221; That’s pretty interesting because they’re non-technical controls that weren’t that common in our main report. They&#8217;re also difficult to substantiate or quantify: what you think is clear reporting to your executives might not seem clear to them. What does a &#8220;sound security strategy&#8221; look like as opposed to an &#8220;unsound&#8221; one? And everyone can say that IT and security &#8220;work together,&#8221; but which areas of cooperation are the most important? We have an opportunity here to dig deeper in future research.</p>\n<p>More achievable, plus significantly correlated with overall success? This is probably the closest to a “quick win” that we’re going to get. Don’t ignore the other practices here just because the data scientists didn’t label them as “statistically significant.” If you group a number of them together, you might turn them into significant boosts (see below).</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #6abf4b;\"><strong>Safe Investments</strong></span></h2>\n<p>It’s also worth noting that the practices in the upper left (hard but effective) are the ones that kept showing up in the report. We’ve labeled those “safe investments” because the data strongly supports their weighty contribution to security program success &#8230; but those gains likely won’t come easy for every organization. They not only require strong cooperation across the board, with all areas of IT and external partners, but they may be hard to justify from a functional standpoint: the tech works fine, why should we keep updating it?</p>\n<p>The one thing this chart doesn&#8217;t capture is the potential cumulative effect of doing several of the practices. Each one here is mapped against its individual likelihood of contributing to your program&#8217;s success, but if you did, say, five of the ones that most respondents say they were able to do well, how would that increase your outcomes? I&#8217;m not a data scientist myself, but I would caution against the temptation to take these numbers and add or multiply them somehow (2% + 2% +3% equals a 7% better outcome!). Remember, these statistics aren&#8217;t guarantees, but it&#8217;s probably safe to say that even if one practice, successfully done, didn&#8217;t pan out to improve your outcomes, doing a few more practices well would raise your chances of getting some level of improvement.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story is that &#8220;quick wins&#8221; in security are neither quick, nor are they a total win. But we did make you click, didn&#8217;t we? And you may find some practice areas to focus on that are more easily achievable and have a good chance of incrementally boosting your organization&#8217;s security posture.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #6abf4b;\"><strong>Additional Resources</strong></span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Access the full <a href=\"http://cisco.com/go/securityoutcomes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cisco 2021 Security Outcomes Study</a></li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https://blogs.cisco.com/tag/securityoutcomes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog series</a> with more relevant information as we continue to analyze the data</li>\n<li>Regions and verticals specific <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/security-outcomes-study.html#~global-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">companion reports</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CiscoBlogSecurity/~4/6aFb8-L1PLY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

So when they said they were “disagreeing,” we don’t actually know whether a given practice was hard to do, or blocked for another reason, but we can guess from our own experiences that it might not be straightforward to accomplish.\nGiven those caveats as a backdrop, let’s look at some comparisons between security practices that many respondents said they were doing or not doing, and security practices that appeared to have a strong statistical correlation with good security outcomes.\n\nThe figure shown here places all security practices on grid according to the percentage of respondents reporting adherence (x axis) and the increase in probability of overall program success attributed to each practice.\nPractices toward the upper right are, according to the data, more often implemented successfully and are highly correlated with gains in program success. The somewhat bad/sad news is that there aren’t any practices that land squarely in that quadrant. Sorry folks — as we know, security is hard.\n \n\n \nQuick Wins\nShort of that, we can examine the lower right and middle-ish areas of the chart to see which practices are still significantly correlated but appear to be achievable by more respondents. “Clear reporting to execs” is probably the quickest win, followed by a toss-up between “Sound security strategy” and “IT & security work together.” That’s pretty interesting because they’re non-technical controls that weren’t that common in our main report. They’re also difficult to substantiate or quantify: what you think is clear reporting to your executives might not seem clear to them. What does a “sound security strategy” look like as opposed to an “unsound” one? And everyone can say that IT and security “work together,” but which areas of cooperation are the most important? We have an opportunity here to dig deeper in future research.\nMore achievable, plus significantly correlated with overall success? This is probably the closest to a “quick win” that we’re going to get. Don’t ignore the other practices here just because the data scientists didn’t label them as “statistically significant.” If you group a number of them together, you might turn them into significant boosts (see below).\nSafe Investments\nIt’s also worth noting that the practices in the upper left (hard but effective) are the ones that kept showing up in the report. We’ve labeled those “safe investments” because the data strongly supports their weighty contribution to security program success … but those gains likely won’t come easy for every organization. They not only require strong cooperation across the board, with all areas of IT and external partners, but they may be hard to justify from a functional standpoint: the tech works fine, why should we keep updating it?\nThe one thing this chart doesn’t capture is the potential cumulative effect of doing several of the practices. Each one here is mapped against its individual likelihood of contributing to your program’s success, but if you did, say, five of the ones that most respondents say they were able to do well, how would that increase your outcomes? I’m not a data scientist myself, but I would caution against the temptation to take these numbers and add or multiply them somehow (2% + 2% +3% equals a 7% better outcome!). Remember, these statistics aren’t guarantees, but it’s probably safe to say that even if one practice, successfully done, didn’t pan out to improve your outcomes, doing a few more practices well would raise your chances of getting some level of improvement.\nThe moral of the story is that “quick wins” in security are neither quick, nor are they a total win. But we did make you click, didn’t we? And you may find some practice areas to focus on that are more easily achievable and have a good chance of incrementally boosting your organization’s security posture.\nAdditional Resources\nAccess the full Cisco 2021 Security Outcomes Study\nA blog series with more relevant information as we continue to analyze the data\nRegions and verticals specific companion reports",

A virtual Data Store supports a 3-node database cluster with flow ingest from virtual Flow Collectors.  This new architecture decouples ingest from data storage to offer the following benefits:\nQuery and reporting response times improved by a significant (10x faster!) magnitude\nScalable and long-term telemetry storage capabilities with no need for additional Flow Collectors\nEnterprise-class data resiliency to allow for seamless data availability during virtual machine failures\nIncreased data ingest capacity of up to 220K flows per second (FPS)\nFlexible deployment options – as a fully virtualized appliance, the Virtual Data Store does not require additional rack space and can be rapidly deployed using your existing infrastructure\nEnhanced security analytics\nAs threats continue to evolve, so do the analytical capabilities of Secure Network Analytics to deliver fast and high-fidelity threat detections. The cloud-based machine learning engine has been updated to include:\nSystem alarms have been ported to appear as notifications in the Web UI\nBrand new confirmed threat detections related to ransomware, remote access trojans (RAT) and malware distribution\nFigure 4. New confirmed ransomware, remote access trojan (RAT) and malware distribution-related threat detections.\nTo learn more about this release, check out the Release 7.3.1 Release Notes.\nDon’t have Secure Network Analytics?

Maintaining the resiliency of critical data, assets, systems, and the network is mission-critical; crucial to meeting business goals.

To do this at scale and speed requires the integration of a suite of application security tools in the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that automate posture assessment and provide visibility to help manage security risks.</p>\n<p>At Cisco, we learned early on that application security processes were inhibiting our business agility. We knew we had to embrace an Agile and DevOps culture as early adopters to deliver software products based on business demands rapidly and iteratively. Agile DevOps without application security automation leads to a &#8220;hurry up and wait&#8221; situation, where some processes move quickly only to be bogged down by others. With evolving technologies such as cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, open-source as well as daily and frequent release cycles, it is hard for application security teams to keep up with the threat landscape. In a typical modern application development and deployment technology stack, 80% of the code base is comprised of third-party software. Only 20% is custom code. Most of the security breaches we have seen in recent years were entirely preventable had there been necessary security measures taken, not only for the custom code but also for the third-party software.</p>\n<p>We set out to create a DevSecOps culture that empowers the application teams to continuously build and deploy secure applications instead of being gated by a central security function. To do this, we integrated and orchestrated a suite of application security tools within CI/CD pipelines under a program called Continuous Security Buddy (CSB) for CI/CD pipeline edition. It enables the development teams to ramp up their application security program while making application security transparent and friction-free.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_353628\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-353628\" style=\"width: 626px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture3-1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img srcset='https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture3-1-300x166.png 300w, https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture3-1.png 626w' sizes='(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px' loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-353628 size-full\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/blogs-images/ciscoblogs/1/2021/02/Picture3-1.png\"   alt=\"DevSecOps: Security Implemetation as Code\" width=\"626\" height=\"347\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-353628\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span style=\"color: #6abf4b;\"><strong>Figure 1: DevSecOps – Security Implementation as Code</strong></span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We used the following basic principles in the design of the program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Co-design and co-develop the security automation solution so it can work for the DevOps teams</li>\n<li>Integrate the DevSecOps workflow and empower the developers by giving them the flexibility to choose their application security tools</li>\n<li>Propagate security compliance requirements and hence eliminate the security friction points between security and development teams that impact development velocity</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #6abf4b;\"><strong>Co-design and Co-development of the Solution</strong></span></h2>\n<p>We initially co-designed and co-developed CSB for CI/CD re-usable automated security capabilities using joint scrum planning with teams from <a href=\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/conferencing/webex.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cisco Webex</a>.

These features are all available as part of the shared library and the user needs to add configuration parameters to run it.

A consolidated report is generated (as shown in Figure 2), which shows an overall compliance score that considers which scans were enabled in the job, (e.g., binary scans, static code analysis, and dynamic scans).
